Welcome to Game Theory.

It's a pretty simple idea... at least that's how it's going to start off!

For a basic understanding of Game Theory have a look at the following Wiki page:

What I'll actually be trying to implement is my own version of The El Farol Bar problem; take a look:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem

The basic idea is that there's an odd number of players who will decide whether or not to go to a bar on a given night. 

As there's an odd number of players this means that there will always be more people who decide to go to the bar than not go to the bar, or vise-versa.

The game is simple - be in the minority.
